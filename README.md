# CS50x 2023 Final Project - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/oRIK3ZCHKTs
#### Description:


Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This project showcases the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms in an interactive and visually appealing manner. I have dedicated numerous hours to create this final project, and I am excited to share it with you.

## Inspiration

The primary inspiration for this project came from week 3 of our course, "Algorithms," where David introduced us to the world of sorting algorithms and taught us how to think algorithmically. I was captivated by the elegance and power of these sorting algorithms, which fueled my passion for creating this visualizer.

## Files

This project consists of three essential files:

1. **index.html**: This HTML file serves as the main entry point for the visualizer. It provides the structure and layout for the user interface.
2. **script.js**: The JavaScript file, script.js, contains the logic and functionality of the visualizer. It handles the array generation, algorithm selection, and the animation of sorting.
3. **style.css**: The style.css file is responsible for the visual design and presentation of the visualizer. It defines the aesthetics and layout of the user interface elements.

## Getting Started

To embark on your exciting journey with the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, let's ensure you have all the necessary components and information to fully immerse yourself in this interactive experience.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A modern web browser: The visualizer is designed to be compatible with major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. Make sure you have the latest version of your preferred browser installed for optimal performance and compatibility.

2. The project files: To begin your exploration, you will need to download the project files mentioned earlier. Ensure you have all three essential files—**index.html**, **script.js**, and **style.css**—available on your local machine. You can obtain these files from the provided source or by cloning the project repository from the designated location.

### Launching the Visualizer

Now that you have fulfilled the prerequisites, let's dive into launching the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.

1. Open your preferred web browser: Launch your web browser by double-clicking its icon or accessing it from your computer's application menu. Ensure you have closed any unnecessary tabs or windows to provide an optimal environment for the visualizer.

2. Navigate to the project directory: Using your preferred file explorer or command-line interface, navigate to the directory where you have stored the project files. Locate the **index.html** file, which serves as the main entry point for the visualizer.

3. Open the visualizer: Double-click the **index.html** file, or right-click and select "Open with" followed by choosing your preferred web browser from the list. The browser will render the visualizer and display it on your screen.

### Exploring the Visualizer

Congratulations! You have successfully launched the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer. Let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with its interactive features and functionalities.

Upon entering the visualizer, you will be greeted by an aesthetically pleasing interface that presents you with a randomized array and a user-friendly menu. This menu allows you to select your desired sorting algorithm from the available options, such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort.

Additionally, the visualizer provides you with the flexibility to customize the array size according to your preference. You can specify the number of elements you wish to include, ranging from a small set for quick sorting to a larger set for more comprehensive visualization.

To interact with the visualizer, you can utilize the intuitive buttons that are strategically placed within the interface. These buttons allow you to generate a new array with a single click or initiate the selected sorting algorithm, initiating the captivating sorting process.

As you start the sorting algorithm, sit back, relax, and witness the algorithm's magic unfold before your eyes. The visualizer will dynamically animate each step of the sorting process, visually demonstrating how the algorithm rearranges the elements in the array. Observe the mesmerizing movement of the elements as they gradually find their rightful positions, offering you a profound understanding of the algorithm's mechanics.

### Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to explore and engage with my Sorting Algorithm Visualizer. I genuinely hope that this educational and entertaining experience leaves you with a deeper appreciation for the art and science of sorting algorithms. Enjoy your journey through the visualizer, and may it inspire you to further explore the captivating world of computer science and algorithmic thinking.
